## Rose Amélia 
 
The Rose Amélia project is my second project as a programmer, I worked on it for two weeks and I got this result.
Rose Amélia is a psychologist with whom I worked for a while, in the midst of our sessions she showed interest in my work and requested a website to publicize her work, thus this project was born.
